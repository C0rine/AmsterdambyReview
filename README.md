# Amsterdam by Review

Amsterdam by Review is a prototype for a search-engine that uses reviews and meta data from Google Maps and applies sentiment analysis to it. In this repository you will only find the python code we used to retrieve the data and the code for the website (using [Calaca](https://github.com/romansanchez/Calaca) made by Roman Sanchez). In between these two we used [https://www.elastic.co/](Elastic Search). 

Amsterdam by Review was made for the course Web Search as part of the MSc Information Studies: Human Centered Multimedia of the University of Amsterdam.
